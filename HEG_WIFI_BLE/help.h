        Welcome to HEG Biofeedback with the Internet of Things!
        </h3>
        <p>
        This hardware and software package is designed to have a minimum barrier 
        for entry for users wanting to use this unique form of brain training. 
        Hemoencephalography (HEG) simply means using blood flow signals for feedback
        data from the body while doing certain actions or experiencing different mental
        states.
        
        Hemo - Meaning blood.
        Encephalography - Imaging brain structure through a particular medium.
        
        This device you are using now belongs to particular classification called fNIRS
        or "functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy" as we are using Red and InfraRed LEDs
        reflected into a light sensor to measure an important component of brain activity.
        It is a reflectance-based pulse oximeter in closest comparison, and we can gather
        the same data, we just use it in a "functional" way to measure overall O2 saturation
        of a particular region of your brain.

        The HEG sensor is able to capture signals from about an inch deep in your skull
        wherever it has been placed. This is done mainly on our forehead and the pre-frontal
        cortex as this is the most accessible area, but smaller sensors will allow for 
        measuring other parts of the scalp. 
        
        The primary usage of these sensors in our case is for direct aerobic exercise for 
        your brain. Normally you energize your brain through normal diet and exercise -
        which add fuel and flexibility to your neurons. Aerobic exercise encourages good
        blood flow and stronger capillary development. It not only stretches your back out
        and loosens your limbs up - but your brain too! This causes energy to be more
        available to your system in general and for it to get more used to stress and strain.

        Our brain cells require energy to be immediately available to fire. Neurons receive
        their energy on-demand through astrocytes connected to innumerable tiny capillary tubes
        that wrap around your cells in order to sustain them. Stress, poor diet, dehydration,
        or any number of things that can reduce your well-being have some of their strongest
        impacts on brain health due to the incredibly sensitive and intricate ecosystem they form
        in your noggin. 
        
        We can see correlations with poor health and poor state of mind directly with HEG by 
        massive reductions or even over-activity in normal blood flow levels, as well as improving 
        it through HEG-assisted exercise. This has overall benefits to your body and mind - which 
        are not really separate. The main benefits are you will feel more aware, quicker on your 
        feet, and able to make better choices when your brain is in shape. The directness of this 
        procedure seems to extend the benefits of normal exercise to your brain in very profound 
        ways, and may shed light some important ideas about the nature of living consciousness and 
        memory.
        
        Before you embark, however, it is important to understand the risks and the experimental 
        nature of this work. While general exposure to the HEG is safe, you can over-train and give 
        yourself headaches or fatigue - kind of like normal exhaustion after a hard exercise. So 
        please learn our recommendations and some of the known side-effects when you are first 
        starting with HEG brain exercises.
