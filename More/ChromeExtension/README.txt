To add this chrome extension, you must find your Extensions page, enable Developer Mode (top right corner slider usually), then select "Load Unpacked" and select this folder. 

This extension enables Serial USB connectivity to your devices on top of the WiFi, as well as more interactive features (e.g. threeJS) when offline. You can even pin it to your desktop as a shortcut like normal software. Pretty cool!

To use the USB connection, click "Get" in the top right of the page if you don't see the "Silicon Labs" device option (the HEG), then click "Set" to connect to it and allow you to control it with the interface. You can right click the page and click "Inspect" to see the data stream and check errors if you are getting any.
