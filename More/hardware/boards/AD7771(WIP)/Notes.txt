Modular design model:

Microcontroller module (rigid)
ADC module (rigid)
Sensor mount module (flexible)

This means the ADC and uC are reusable. We can design noise control indepedently to deal with low intensity signals (EEG/ELF), and have the essential components be individual and easier to propagate for more people to use for their own applications. Boom, progress. Open source fo lyfe
